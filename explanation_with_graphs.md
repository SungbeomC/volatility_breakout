(The first graph visualizes two different cumulative returns of investing in Amazon when employing the volatility breakout strategy and the same tactics taking into account the moving average, and the second graph shows the same index of investing in Apple. VB stands for the volatility breakout, and MA means the moving average).


Looking at these two graphs of hypothetical investments in Amazon and Apple, we can note  that using the volatility breakout strategy only and merging it with consideration of the moving average both result in quite significant cumulative return. In case of Amazon, the graph presents that the cumulative return of solely relying on the strategy without taking into account the moving average is far higher than mixing two approaches. On the other hand, in case of Apple, whether an investor adds the moving average as another factor of making buying decisions in the strategy seems to have no conspicuous disparities in the cumulative return. There are even some intervals on the graph where the cumulative return of considering the moving average significantly exceeds that of using the strategy but not including the moving average. Nonetheless, we should put more emphasis on recent data: from 2020 to the present, the cumulative return of utilizing the volatility strategy without  the moving average has been outstripping that of combining these two methods. Since adding a conditional statement that executes buying decision only when the open price of a stock is higher than the moving average can decrease the risk of an investment as a buffer, intuitively, the volatility breakout strategy taking into account the moving average is expected to be less lucrative.

(The first graph demonstrates two different drawdowns of investing in Amazon when using the volatility breakout strategy and the same tactics considering the moving average, while the second graph portrays the same index of investing in Apple).

For the two graphs above, drawdowns when relying on the strategy alone are overall larger than those when incorporating the moving average into the strategy. More importantly, according to the maximum drawdown in percentage calculated by codes in this repository, when the strategy considers the moving average, the maximum drawdown of investing in Apple declines from 25.04% to 23.33%, and that of investing in Amazon diminishes from 15.51% to 12.59%. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, including an analysis of the moving average in the volatility breakout strategy can increase the safety level of an investment, allowing investors to feel more secured and comfortable when making decisions.
